The project involves the use of a Raspberry PI PICO 2 W as a microcontroller programmed in PYTHON, an OLED display with SSD1306 chip and a rotary encoder with integrated switch. The time displayed on the OLED display can be changed or locked via a web page loaded on the Android phone. The web page is called "Index.html" and must be sent via email to your Android phone.
